        <h1>School Policy School Year 2022-2023</h1>
        <p>The following policies are highlighted and are anchored from the DepEd order no. 40, series of 2012. These are the most common tools that authorities should focus on the implementation of school policy for school year 2022-2023 considering the current situation we are all experiencing in the new normal modality of learning.</p>

        <p>Some of our learners in these trying times are exposed and vulnerable to such challenges. The school committee on school policy and child protection program is adhering to the call of the department in protecting the welfare of these learners.</p>

        <p>Every child deserves protection and should be given equal rights, the right to live, to be educated, to be protected, for their development and improvement.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Attendance</h2>
        <p>Students are required to attend his/her classes every day from Monday to Friday. In case of his/her absence, he/she should secure a letter of excuse duly signed by his/her parent/guardian. If the student is absent for 3 or more days consecutively, the class adviser will make a follow-up through call or text, sending a letter and if there is no reply, the class adviser and the school guidance counselor will do a home visitation.</p>
        
        <h4>Action Taken:</h4>
        <p>1. Advisers should follow-up with the learners through calls, text, chat, or through their Group Chats (GCs).</p>
        <p>2. In the event, the learner has not complied with the call of the adviser, the Guidance Coordinator will intervene and invite the parents/guardians through sending letters for a short conference.</p>
      
        <h2>2. Tardiness</h2>
        <p>Coming to school late for 30 minutes during the first-period class and or on the succeeding classes (8 academic subjects) is considered an act of tardiness. Similar to attendance, students who failed to comply with the needed tasks and modules (blended learning) on time are considered late. Late submission of requirements and other related tasks should be noted by the adviser for future reference and guidance.</p>
   
        <h4>Action Taken:</h4>
        <p>1. Advisers should follow-up with learners through calls, text, chat, or through their Group Chats (GCs).</p>
        <p>2. In the event, the learner has not complied with the call of the adviser, the class adviser will refer the case to the school disciplinarian. The Guidance Coordinator will intervene and invite the parents/guardians for a short conference as needed.</p>
    
        <h2>3. Cutting Classes</h2>
        <p>This is a very common issue in all schools especially during face-to-face classes; students who are not attending classes regularly are considered as cutting class.</p>
        
        <h4>Action Taken:</h4>
        <p>1. Advisers should follow-up with the learners through calls, text, chat, or through their Group Chats (GCs).</p>

        <h2>4. Physical Abuse</h2>
        <p>Refers to the maltreatment of a child, whether habitual or not, which includes any of the following: psychological or physical abuse, neglect, cruelty, sexual abuse, and emotional maltreatment.</p>
        
        <p>No one deserves abuse in any form. Learners in this time of pandemic (New Normal) experience physical abuse within the premises of their houses and even outside their respective homes. This form of abuse also occurs in peer organizations in the community (gang and other related notorious groups) wherein parents should strictly monitor the whereabouts of their children. Learners also experience mental depression where the behavior affects at some point. In this connection, parents and guardians should be the first to understand and embrace the needs of their children. Teachers, especially the advisers, should always make a follow-up in monitoring the condition of their students.</p>
        
        <h4>Action Taken:</h4>

        <h2>5. Verbal Abuse</h2>
        <p>This is a very strong form of abuse that is happening around. Learners of this generation, with the present condition of the learning modality, tend to overdo and overreact to mild issues, becoming very brutal in terms of expressing themselves with offensive words.</p>

        <p>This act is expressed by many people, especially teenagers of this generation. They seem to remain calm and think of it as a normal thing, but bullying really causes a lot of depression and leaves a mark on the person's lives.

        <h2>7. Child Exploitation (Labor/Sex)</h2>
